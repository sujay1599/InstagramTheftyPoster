This Python script automates the process of scraping and uploading Instagram reels using the `instagrapi` library. It allows you to scrape reels from specified Instagram profiles, download them, and upload them with new descriptions and optional hashtags. The script also supports the periodic deletion of uploaded reels.

## Features

- Scrape reels from specified Instagram profiles.
- Download and save reels along with their captions.
- Upload reels to your Instagram account with new descriptions.
- Optionally add reels to your Instagram story.
- Periodically delete uploaded reels based on user-defined intervals.
- Use hashtags in the reel descriptions.
- Interval-based scraping and uploading.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- `instagrapi==1.17.0`
- `openai==1.35.13`
- `pyyaml==6.0`
- `requests==2.28.1`
- `rich==10.15.2`
- `pillow`
- `browser-cookie3`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/instagram-reels-scraper-uploader.git
   cd instagram-reels-scraper-uploader
   ```

2. Install the required packages using `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run `start.py` to create the `config.yaml` file:
   ```bash
   python start.py
   ```
   Follow the prompts to enter your configuration details. This will generate a `config.yaml` file with the necessary settings, including encrypted Instagram credentials.

## Usage

Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Configuration

The `config.yaml` file will be generated by running `start.py`. It includes the following settings:

- **Instagram Credentials**: Provide your Instagram username and password. These will be encrypted and stored securely.
- **Scraping Settings**:
  - `enabled`: Set to `true` to enable scraping.
  - `profiles`: Comma-separated list of Instagram profiles to scrape reels from.
  - `num_reels`: Number of reels to scrape per profile.
  - `scrape_interval_minutes`: Interval in minutes between scraping sessions.
- **Uploading Settings**:
  - `enabled`: Set to `true` to enable uploading.
  - `upload_interval_minutes`: Interval in minutes between uploads.
  - `add_to_story`: Set to `true` to add reels to your Instagram story.
- **Deleting Settings**:
  - `periodically_delete_reels_uploaded`: Set to `true` to enable periodic deletion of uploaded reels.
  - `delete_interval_minutes`: Interval in minutes between deletions (set to `0` for immediate deletion after upload).

  - `use_hashtags`: Set to `true` to use hashtags in the reel descriptions.
  - `hashtags_list`: List of hashtags to include in the reel descriptions (if `use_hashtags` is `true`).

### Logging

The script maintains a log file (`upload_log.txt`) to keep track of uploaded reels and a timestamp file (`last_scraped_timestamp.txt`) to track the last scraping time.
